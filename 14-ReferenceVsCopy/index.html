        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice()
        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players)

            name: 'Vu Tran',

    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 29 })
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this
    // is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
